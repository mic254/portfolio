    <h2>3D Anime</h2>
    <p>3D anime, also known as CG anime, is a type of animation that uses computer-generated imagery (CGI) to create characters, settings, and objects in a three-dimensional space. Here are some examples of 3D anime:

        Knights of Sidonia: This science-fiction anime series is set in the distant future, where humanity lives aboard massive spaceships and battles giant alien creatures. The 3D animation gives the show a unique visual style.
        
        Ajin: This action-horror anime follows a young man who discovers that he is an immortal "Ajin" and is hunted by the government. The show's 3D animation is used to great effect during the intense action sequences.
        
        Land of the Lustrous: This fantasy anime is set in a world where gemstones are sentient beings who must defend themselves against attacks from mysterious beings called "Lunarians." The show's 3D animation gives the gemstones a crystalline look.
        
        Blame!: This cyberpunk anime is set in a dystopian future where humanity lives in a vast, labyrinthine city. The 3D animation is used to create the intricate, sprawling cityscapes and the menacing robots that inhabit them</p>
